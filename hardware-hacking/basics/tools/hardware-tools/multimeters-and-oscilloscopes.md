# Multimeters & Oscilloscopes

Multimeters and oscilloscopes are enabling the measurement and analysis of electrical signals and parameters in circuits.

## Multimeters

Usage

* Voltage Measurement:&#x20;
  * Measure AC and DC voltage levels in circuits.
* Current Measurement:&#x20;
  * Measure current flowing through a circuit (both AC and DC).
* Resistance Measurement:&#x20;
  * Determine the resistance of components and circuits.
* Continuity Testing:&#x20;
  * Check if there is a complete path for current flow, often with an audible beep.
* Diode Testing:&#x20;
  * Test the functionality of diodes.

Theory

* Basic Functionality:&#x20;
  * Multimeters operate based on the principle of Ohm's Law, using a combination of resistors and transistors to measure voltage, current, and resistance.
* Modes:&#x20;
  * Most multimeters have different modes for measuring voltage, current, resistance, and continuity.

Models:

* Entry-Level
  * ANENG A830L(<$10) : very cheap one from Aliexpress for example, can break though
* Mid-Range
  * crenova ms8223d ($25): Frequently used by myself, very reliable
* High-End
  * Fluke 115 (>$200): very precise, but not really needed if you are not a professional

## Oscilloscopes

Usage

* Waveform Visualization:&#x20;
  * Display and analyze the waveform of electrical signals over time.
* Signal Analysis:&#x20;
  * Measure parameters like frequency, amplitude, rise time, and signal integrity.
* Debugging
  * Identify issues in electronic designs, such as timing problems or noise in signals.
* Protocol Analysis
  * Analyze digital signals and communication protocols.

Theory

* Basic Functionality
  * Oscilloscopes measure voltage over time and display the results on a screen, usually as a graph. They work by sampling the input signal at high speeds and reconstructing the waveform.
* Components
  * Key components include the vertical amplifier (for voltage), horizontal time base (for time), and triggering system (to stabilize the waveform display).

Models

* Entry-Level
  * PeakTech 1401($200) : Entry level, good reviews
* Mid-Range
  * Rigol MSO5000 Serie ($1000): Used by myself, very reliable
* High-End
  * SDS2000X ($3000): High bandwidth, 2GSa/s sampling rate, large memory depth, but not really needed if you are not a professional
